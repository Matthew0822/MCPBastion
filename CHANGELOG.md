## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-31

### Added

- **Rust gateway (`gateway/`)** — a `std`-only CLI, `mcp-bastion`, that reads
  newline-delimited JSON-RPC from stdin, evaluates each message against a
  policy, and forwards permitted (and redacted) messages to stdout.
  - Honest single-pass JSON field extractor (`json_scan`) that skips string
    literals, tracks nesting, and returns raw value spans. It is explicitly
    **not** a full JSON parser and never claims to be.
  - Line-oriented policy format (`policy`) with `allow_tool` / `deny_tool`
    glob rules (deny wins), `redact_arg` patterns, `max_bytes`, `max_depth`,
    `rate_limit` / `rate_window_ms`, and a configurable `redaction_mask`.
  - Sliding-window rate limiter.
  - Argument-value redaction (`redact`) that preserves surrounding bytes.
  - Structured, one-line-per-event JSON audit records (`audit`).
  - Pure decision pipeline (`engine`) covered by unit and integration tests.
  - `--stats` summary line and deterministic `--epoch-ms` mode for demos.
- **TypeScript console (`console/`)** — a dependency-free (Node standard
  library only) viewer:
  - `report` — aggregate an audit log into decision counts, per-tool stats,
